Symptoms
Jobs are not automatically triggered when after a Push or Pull request event in GitHub (and/or GitHub Enterprise)
Diagnostic/Treatment
Pre-condition : Jenkins (resp. GitHub) can reach out to GitHub (resp. Jenkins)
This troubleshooting requires from analysis of GitHub which generates a payload and Jenkins which parses it.

A. On GitHub
A.1 Webhook has not been generated or it is disabled (red cross)
Check that “GitHub-API-User” has Admin permissions for the repo. Or Owner rol for Webhook at Organization level.
If GitHub Username and Password is used for GitHub plugin configuration, validate that the user has not enabled 2FA.
A.2 When the Webhook is generated
As explained in GitHub Testing Webhooks.

Click on Redeliver and evaluate the response and see if the Jenkins receive the payload in B.3 GitHub Hooks Problems Console and B.4 Dedicated Logger.

B. On Jenkins
B.1 Enforce to regenerate all Webhook for your Jenkins instance
Go Manage Jenkins > GitHub plugin > Advance > Re-registers hooks for all jobs.

B.2 Validate Plugin Configuration
Identify which GitHub Server (“GitHub Server X”) contains the repository/organization where webhook is failing.
For that server (“GitHub Server X”), validate its “GitHub API User” and its Rate limits by Manage Jenkins > GitHub plugin > “GitHub Server X” > Test Connection
Verify credentials
Credentials verified for user "GitHub-API-User", rate limit: 4994
3.Validate the configuration of $JENKINS_HOME/github-plugin-configuration.xml:

<github-plugin-configuration plugin="github@1.29.4">
  <configs>
    <github-server-config>
      <name>GITHUB</name>
      <apiUrl>https://api.github.com</apiUrl>
      <manageHooks>true</manageHooks>
      <credentialsId>GH-mock-carlosrodlop-ST</credentialsId>
      <clientCacheSize>20</clientCacheSize>
    </github-server-config>
  </configs>
  <hookSecretConfig>
    <credentialsId></credentialsId>
  </hookSecretConfig>
A parent <github-server-config> is need to each of the GitHub and GitHub Enterprise Servers.
For each server, you need to have configured a Crendential Secret Text GitHUb API Token: <credentialsId>GH-example-APIToken-ST</credentialsId>
For each server, you need to have configured <manageHooks>true</manageHooks> to enable Re-registers hooks for all jobs
B.3 Validate Job Configuration
Review the plugin a jobs configurations as explained in GitHub WebHook Configuration for each of type of jobs.

B.4 GitHub Hooks Problems Console
Available from Manage Jenkins > GitHub Hooks Problems Console only and if only any of Automatic Webhooks has not been setup in GitHub.

This page shows problems with webhooks, and ignored projects.

Notes: Another warning messages also can be found at:

a. in Manage Jenkins

b. in the trigger configuration for For Non-Multibranch jobs

B.5 Dedicated Logger
Create a logger for GitHub in https://<JENKINS_URL>/log/ including:

B.6 Jenkins logs
The following traces illustrate successful build triggers on Jenkins logs:

Webhook register

INFO: Called registerHooks() for 1 jobs

INFO: GitHub webhooks activated for job myJobExample with [GitHubRepositoryName[host=github.com,username=example-org,repository=example-repo]] (events: [PUSH, REPOSITORY])
In case the webhook was sucessfully, Jenkins receives a PING event from repo webhook so a similar trace like the following would appear:

Nov 09, 2017 6:34:39 PM org.jenkinsci.plugins.github.webhook.subscriber.PingGHEventSubscriber onEvent
INFO: PING webhook received from repo <https://github.example.com/example-org/example-repo>!
